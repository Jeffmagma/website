# Personal Website

This is my personal website, mainly an experiment in learning [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), and [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/), with a bit of [three.js](https://threejs.org/) as well. I started this project after a job interview where I had to perform some simple tasks in React, despite never touching it. Even though I didn't do so well in the interview, the concept of React intrigued me and I set on to learn more about both the library and website design.

## This website uses:

- [React](https://github.com/facebook/react/), a very popular front-end, component-based javascript library to manage the user interface
- [Next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js), a framework for React that manages routing, search engine optimization, serverside rendering, images, and much more to deploy the site
- [Framer Motion](https://github.com/framer/motion), a framework to manage animations on React components
- [three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/), a library to render three-dimensional scenes in webpages using WebGL
- [react-three-fiber](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber), a React renderer for three.js that uses React components to initialize three.js objects to add to a scene
